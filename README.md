3.Userdefined FastReader Class (which uses bufferedReader and StringTokenizer):   This method uses the time advantage of BufferedReader and StringTokenizer and the advantage of user-defined methods for less typing and therefore a faster input altogether. These get accepted with a time of 1.23 s and this method is very much recommended as it is easy to remember and is fast enough to meet the needs of most of the question in competitive coding.
